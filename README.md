Two scenarios where data science is used to get an answer.
Each folder consists of the data used, a report PDF and the code.

<h2>The X-files problem </h2><br>
<h4>Context:</h4>
I would like to hire you to tell me where I should go if I want to see an U.F.O. or interview people that claim sightings.” <br>
“Make sure you present your findings in a way my shareholders will understand. The truth may be out there... and no one is doing anything.” <br>

<h2>The Lapardist problem </h2><br>
<h4>Context:</h4>
<strong>Prime Minister:</strong> “Our friends here seem to have run into a bit of an issue, see, some diamonds seem to have been stolen. Problem is, the only person... goblin, sorry“ he says apologetically to Krenk ” to have seen them is our distinguished guest, Krenk.” <br>

<strong>Fidelious: </strong>“And while the Ministry completely believes Krenk as to the diamonds’ worth, we need another person to validate his claim. Safety policies, you see.” <br>

<strong>Prime Minister: </strong>“So, since you’re the best data scientist in our country, I thought you could help. Mr. Krenk will provide you with the characteristics of the missing diamonds and we need you to <strong>create a model to value them.</strong>” <br>
